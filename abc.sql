"The global death toll from the coronavirus topped a staggering 3 million people amid repeated setbacks in the worldwide vaccination campaign and a deepening crisis in India, Brazil, and France, among other places. And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. You can track coronavirus cases, deaths and testing rates at the national and State levels here. A list of State Helpline numbers is available as well. \n Delhi has less than 100 ICU beds left, says CM Kejriwal Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that the COVID-19 situation in Delhi was worrisome as the positivity rate in the past 24 hours had reached 30% from 24.56% the previous day and that there was a shortage of ICU beds and oxygen. In a digital address, he said that there were less than 100 ICU beds left in Delhi and there was a shortage of oxygen. We have asked the Central government for help and we are receiving it as well.

"Map emerging virus data with micro-containment measures: L-G",
25,
"Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Friday called for greater coordination in mapping of emerging coronavirus data with the activation of micro-containment measures on the ground. After inspecting the COVID war room at the Emergency Operation Centre of the Disaster Management Authority, Ms. Soundarajan said war room data needed to be translated into graded and effective risk reduction measures in places where incidence of infection was high. In addition to ramping up timely availability of medical facilities to home isolation patients who required it, micro-containment zones needed to be carved out to cut the transmission of COVID-19, she said. She also advised personnel manning the 104 COVID helpline to constantly liaison between patients calling in and hospitals and medical staff. The Lt. Governor, who earlier flagged off two fully-equipped mobile vaccination units, said the vehicles would be sent to factories that employ 100 workers or more, on a need to basis. She said that all necessary measures were being undertaken on a war-footing to keep the pandemic under control. The administration is in constant touch with officials in the regions of Karaikal, Yanam and Mahe to ascertain the status of COVID-19 control and to address specific requirements, Ms. Soundararajan said. According to the Lt. Governor, it was a creditable achievement that during the Tika Utsav campaign alone, about 53,000 people had been vaccinated in the Union Territory. There was no shortage of vaccines in the Union Territory after the Centre released a consignment of 1.1 lakh vials recently, she said.",

"West Bengal Assembly polls | Jorasanko a prestige battle for BJP",
17,
"In the tightly poised 11 seats in Kolkata city where the Trinamool Congress has held ground in the past, the BJP is hoping to make headway this time around and one of the seats its hopes are pinned on is the ancestral home of the Tagore family, Jorasanko. The area’s fame outside of Kolkata is its connection to the Tagore family, the Thakur Bari or mansion of the Tagore family, former home to Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, and currently a museum. The office of the BJP candidate Meena Devi Purohit is, however, in a crowded area in a corner of a narrow lane, just below the incomplete Vivekananda Setu, a portion of which had crashed in March 2016, in the midst of the last Assembly polls. The tragic toll of that accident numbered 27 and injured scores of others, and the ill-fated flyover remains incomplete. If elected I promise a solution to the flyover issue. I’ll make sure that either the flyover is completed or completely removed. The current situation cannot continue, said Ms Purohit to The Hindu. She has been a corporator in Kolkata for nearly three decades and many civic issues of the area, like better parking lots, rather than any civilisational ones dominate the flier she hands over as her pledges if elected. Both Ms Purohit and the TMC candidate Vivek Gupta are non-Bengalis fighting on the former stomping ground of the Tagore family. Mr Gupta, owner of the Hindi newspaper Sanmarg was earlier a Rajya Sabha MP from the TMC. The area itself is now dominated by trading communities from Rajasthan and labour from Bihar, as it is contiguous to Bara Bazaar, once the largest wholesale market in Asia. The three corporators from the area- Sunita Jhaveri, Vijay Ojha and Ms Purohit are all non-Bengalis.",

"Kerala Assembly polls | 80.53%, turnout of 1987 Assembly election, yet to be surpassed",
17,
"The Left Democratic Front (LDF) had come to power when polling touched an all-time high of 80.53% in the State in the 1987 Assembly polls and 77.35% in the 2016 polls. Since 1957, only the Congress-led alliance had been able to ensure continuity in power and that too way back in 1977. In the elections held after the Emergency, the Congress-led United Front was voted to power and K. Karunakaran became the Chief Minister. But, the fifth Assembly witnessed several political moves and three other Chief Ministers — A.K. Antony, P.K. Vasudevan Nair and C.H. Mohammed Koya. The Assembly was dissolved in 1979 and President’s rule imposed in the State. The previous government led by the Congress alliance was led by Communist Party of India leader C. Achutha Menon as the Congress did not join the Ministry initially after the 1970 elections. The Assembly, which had 133 seats, also had an extra tenure of 18 months as Emergency was imposed in the country and elections could not he held. After the 1980 elections, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led LDF was able to form the government under E.K. Nayanar when the voter turnout was 72.28%, with the LDF securing 93 seats. In 1982, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) came to power when the turnout was 73.56% and K. Karunakaran became the Chief Minister. However, the LDF formed the government in 1987 by bagging 77 seats. E.K. Nayanar again became the Chief Minister. The polling percentage of 80.53 in 1987 continues to be a record in the State. In the 1991 elections, K. Karunakaran became the Chief Minister after the UDF bagged 90 seats and the polling percentage was 73.46. However, in the 1996 elections, the LDF formed the government under E.K. Nayanar again when the polling percentage was 71.66. Congress leader A.K. Antony formed the government after the UDF wrested power from the LDF in the 2001 elections. The polling percentage was 72.22. In 2006, the LDF returned to power under V.S. Achuthanandan when the turnout was 72.38% and the front secured 98 seats. Sticking to its tradition of rotating power, the State again elected the UDF under Oommen Chandy in 2011, with the front securing 72 seats. The turnout was 75.27%. In the 2016 elections, the LDF assumed power bagging 91 seats under Pinarayi Vijayan. The polling percentage was 77.35.",

"The news of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa testing positive for COVID-19 again has created a scare among the political and bureaucratic circles as he had attended an official meeting on Friday and a slew of political rallies in bypoll-bound Belagavi on Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday morning, just before he was confimed COVID-19 positive, he had chaired a meeting on COVID-19 with senior officers and Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar. Many senior IAS officials including Chief Secretary P. Ravikumar, Additional Chief Secretary Health and Family Welfare Jawaid Akthar and BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta. However, many of the officials and the Health Minister continued their day’s work and even convened meetings with their other staff. The CM himself had advised that those who came in contact with him must observe self-quarantine. Many of them justified it saying the meeting convened by the Chief Minister was held outdoors and all of them maintained physical distance and were wearing masks. Dr .Sudhakar who conducted a series of meetings on Friday said that as the Health Minister, it was important that he discharges his functions when the State was facing the second wave of COVID-19. He said that he would engage in his daily work with caution and get tested after four days. On Wednesday and Thursday, the CM had met hundreds of people at Belagavi. He addressed a crowded press meet at Sambra airport in Belagavi on Wednesday and later met party leaders at a private hotel. He then went to Gokak and Mudalagi to attend road shows and rallies.

17,
"The capital district recorded a polling percentage of 70.01% in the Assembly elections on Tuesday, as per the latest information available with the Election Commission. The numbers were bound to slightly increase with the final update of data from polling booths. In the Assembly elections of 2016, the district had recorded a polling percentage of 72.02%. Polling was largely peaceful across the district, except for an isolated incident of violence involving BJP and CPI(M) workers at Kattayikonam in the Kazhakuttam constituency. Police force was deployed in large numbers in the area to prevent further violence. As in the past, the rural areas of the district were ahead of the urban regions in voter enthusiasm, with most of the urban constituencies recording polling percentages lower than 70% and the rural constituencies recording more than 70%. The Aruvikkara constituency, consisting of remote polling stations in the high ranges, recorded the highest polling percentage of 73.27%, while the Thiruvananthapuram constituency in the heart of the city with easily accessible booths had a polling percentage of 61.92%. Nemom, the sole constituency won by the BJP in the State ever and which this year witnessed a tight triangular fight, had a relatively low polling percentage of 69.80%, compared to 74.11% in 2016. The case was similar in Kazhakuttam as well, which had a polling percentage of 69.63%, as against 73.46% last time.",

"Forty-five Assembly seats spread across six districts of the State will go to polls in the fifth phase of polling in West Bengal on April 17. Of the 45 seats, 13 are going to polls in north Bengal and 32 seats will vote in south Bengal. This is the highest number of seats going to polls in any of the eight-phase marathon Assembly elections. Thirteen seats in north Bengal are spread across three districts of north Bengal — five in Darjeeling, seven in Jalpaiguri and one in Kalimpong. In south Bengal, 16 seats are spread across North 24 Parganas, and there are eight each in Nadia and Bardhaman districts. The seats going to polls stretch from the northernmost point of the State in the Darjeeling hills to Basirhat Uttar and Basirhat Dakshin in the Sunderbans. Elections are being held in the tea gardens of the Dooars and also in the urban and rural settlements of North 24 Parganas, Bardhaman and Nadia. A total of 1.13 crore voters are eligible to cast their votes to decide the fate of 342 candidates. Key candidates include senior Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and Siliguri Mayor Asok Bhattacharya, contesting from Siliguri; State Minister Bratya Basu, who is contesting from Dum Dum in the northern fringes of Kolkata; and State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya from Rajarhat’s Gopalpukur seat in North 24 Parganas. In north Bengal, one of the key poll issues is the suffering of tea garden workers labouring under poor wages both in Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri, while agrarian distress continues to be the main issue in Bardhaman and other rural areas of the State. Both the BJP and the TMC have sparred over the benefits of the Centre’s PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and the State government’s Krishak Bandhu scheme, respectively. In districts like North 24 Parganas and Nadia, the contest will be centred around the inroads made by the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the subsequent resistance of the Trinamool Congress. In many of the 45 seats, both the ruling TMC and the BJP are evenly poised. In certain pockets in north Bengal and Bardhaman, the Samyukta Morcha of the Left, the Congress and the Indian Secular Fund (ISF) can make a difference. The BJP ensured that all its heavyweight campaigners, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, party president J.P. Nadda and actor Mithun Chakraborty, addressed several meetings. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee have campaigned in areas going to polls. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also campaigned in Darjeeling district at the eleventh hour for Samyukta Morcha candidates. A lot has changed since the previous phase of the ongoing Assembly polls was held on April 10. The death of four persons on polling day at Sitalkuchi after Central forces opened fire, and the Election Commission of India barring Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and State BJP leaders Dilip Ghosh and Rahul Sinha, from campaigning for a period, has added a new dimension to the fifth phase."

"Young goalkeeper Krishan Pathak, who was one of the architects of India’s superb show against Argentina, said he wants to be in top form for the Tokyo Olympics and is eyeing another superlative performance against Great Britain in the FIH Pro League games next month. The 23-year-old, who earned his 50th international cap during India’s tour of Argentina, played a big role in his side registering back-to-back victories against the reigning Olympic champion in the FIH Pro League this month.  I am very happy to have completed 50 international caps. So much has happened in such a short space of time. I have had the opportunity to play in big tournaments and learnt a lot from my seniors,  Pathak said in a release issued by Hockey India.  The coaches have always believed in my talent. I want to continue working hard and win games for India. Reaching this milestone makes me proud.Impressive While fellow custodian P.R. Sreejesh was brilliant when the visitor won the first match in a penalty shoot-out, Pathak was equally impressive during India’s 3-0 win over the host in the second game.  I got to learn a lot from the Argentina tour. I know I have to prove my worth as a goalkeeper every time I am playing,  said Pathak.  I feel we showed a lot of fight and character there. Over the past year, we’ve had good games against the top sides in the world and I feel that gives us the right kind of boost going into a tournament like the Olympics.  India will play Great Britain in the FIH Pro League on May 8 and 9.  We have to be focussed on the job at hand right now. Hope our good form continues against Great Britain,  Pathak said. For much of his career, Pathak has been Sreejesh’s understudy and thinks the competition for places has only made him better.  There’s so much one can learn from Sreejesh. He’s been playing at the highest level for so many years,  he said.  I have improved as a custodian in the last four years and that is because of what I have gathered and learnt watching people like Sreejesh and others play and train on a daily basis. ",

"Former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko overcame a fiercely determined Ankita Raina 6-2, 5-7, 7-5 to put host Latvia 1-0 ahead in the Billie Jean King Cup World Group playoff tie at the indoor arena in Jurmala on Friday. With the Indian leading 5-4 in the third set, the 23-year-old Ostapenko handled the climactic phase like a champion. However, the 28-year-old Ankita couldn’t close it out, opening the door for the Latvian. Perhaps, a better start could have helped Ankita. Not used to facing an opponent of such quality seemed to be playing on the Indian’s mind as she decided to go on an all-out attack and kept making errors. Though Ostapenko, too, struggled with her serve and strokes, Ankita was unable to capitalise on the opportunities that came her way. Precise and purposeful After shrugging off the excitement of the first set, Ankita was a lot more precise and purposeful in the second set. She jumped to a 2-0 lead and stretched it to 5-2.However, Ostapenko, who found her serving rhythm, fought back. Ankita kept her cool, ran hard during the rallies and placed the ball well to force errors from the Latvian. At 5-6, Ostapenko’s serve let her down again, taking the contest to the decider. After being treated for a hip strain, she got off to a smooth start in the third set. While the Latvian No. 2 became more confident and solid, Ankita’s accuracy failed her at a crucial juncture though she continued to put in the hard yards. Ankita played well above her ranking of 174, pushing a Grand Slam champion to the limit. In the second singles, Anastasija Sevastova breezed past Karman Kaur Thandi 6-4, 6-0. After giving it her all in the first set, the latter ran out of steam as Sevastova made her scamper around the court.

"Rossi has taught me everything I know, says Morbidelli",
12,
"The 2020 MotoGP season saw an exciting title fight and a new crop of winners emerge in the absence of six-time champion Marc Marquez, who missed the season due to an injury during the first round in Qatar. One such rider was Franco Morbidelli who quickly established himself as the new star on the horizon by finishing second in the championship with three wins and two podiums. The 26-year-old, groomed by legend Valentino Rossi since his junior days at the VR46 Riders Academy in Tavullia (Italy), has teamed up with his mentor at Petronas Yamaha SRT for the 2021 season.  VR 46 has taught me everything I know about professional racing. I have always been a quick rider throughout my early career, but the core of my knowledge about professional racing is made by the team at VR46,  said Morbidelli during a chat with The Hindu on Thursday.  Everything I know about being a pro rider — how to train, how to eat, how to behave — I have got it from Vale (Rossi),  he added.Now teammates, Morbidelli said he can learn more from the seven-time MotoGP champion.  Spending time in the same environment will give me a chance to learn other things. I don’t know which ones because I will know them just at that moment and imbibe them.  However, the 2021 season has not started well for the 2020 vice-champion with just four points from the first two races in Qatar.  It is tough, especially after the results I did throughout the second half of last season, to see myself struggling so much in the first two races. But this is MotoGP and if you’re not in the perfect shape, you lose many positions,  said Morbidelli.  (But) we have great trust in ourselves. We will have to regroup and face remaining races with great energy because we know what we can do.  (MotoGP is live on Eurosport, Eurosport HD and live-streamed on Discovery+ from 3.30 p.m. on Sunday).",

"Divya clinches second Asian gold",
12,
"Divya Kakran emerged as the second Indian woman to secure two gold medals in the Asian wrestling championships on Friday as women wrestlers of the country returned four gold medals in Almaty, Kazakhstan. In the continental event marred by the absence of strong countries China and Japan, three Indian women — Divya (72kg), Vinesh Phogat (53kg) and Anshu Malik (57kg) — bagged gold medals. Only Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik settled for silver in 65kg. A day after Sarita Mor became the first Indian woman to win two Asian titles, Divya, who had claimed the 68kg crown in New Delhi a year ago, took the gold in a depleted 72kg field consisting of just four wrestlers. Divya defeated Tsevegmed Enkhbayar of Mongolia 2-0 and Zhamila Bakbergenova of Kazakhstan 8-5.Divya beat Korean Sujin Park 2-0 in her last bout. Olympic-qualified wrestler Vinesh beat Otgonjargal Ganbaatar of Mongolia 11-0 and Meng Hsuan Hsieh of Chinese Taipei 12-0 in the group stage. She reached the final as her Korean opponent Hyunyoung Oh forfeited her match due to an injury. Vinesh then defeated Meng by fall to clinch her maiden title.  The main aim was to wrestle the Japan and China wrestlers, but they are not here. If there is a gold medal on the offering, I will take it,  she said. Anshu cruised against Sevara Eshmuratova of Uzbekistan 10-0, Nazira Marsbek Kyzy of Kyrgyzstan 10-0 and Battsetseg Altantseseg of Mongolia 9-1 before overcoming Korean Shinhye Lee with a 2-2 scoreline. Anshu again beat Battsetseg 3-0 in the final to claim her first Asian gold. Sakshi, who could not win the 62kg Olympic weight trials and qualified in 65kg, lost the summit clash to Bolortungalag Zorigt of Mongolia via fall.",

"Assam Assembly Elections | Now, BPF sends its candidates abroad",
51,
"What the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) can do, ally Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) can do better. Two days after the AIUDF and Congress packed at least 20 of their candidates off to a luxury hotel in Congress-ruled Rajasthan, the BPF sent 10 candidates overseas, apparently amid fears of horse-trading by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prior to the declaration of the Assembly election results on May 2. The Congress, AIUDF and BPF are the main constituents of the 10-party Mahajot and grand alliance that contested the three-phase State polls. An ally of the BJP during the 2016 polls, the BPF had fielded 12 candidates this time. But Rangja Khungur Basumatary, its candidate for the Tamulpur seat, joined the BJP six days ahead of the third and final phase of polling on April 6.Of the remaining 11, all except Minister Pramila Rani Brahma exited Assam on Saturday. There is speculation that they are in adjoining Bhutan, whose nearest point is a few hours drive from western Assam’s Kokrajhar town, where all the candidates were asked to assembly by BPF chief Hagrama Mohilary.  They [the candidates] have left Assam. I have also heard they are out of India, but I cannot say where they have gone as I have not been able to get in touch with them,  Ms. Brahma said. She also said more than a dozen elected members of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) could have left Assam.  They may have gone on vacation or are away because of the possibility of horse-trading at the council level,  she added. The BPF had emerged as the single largest party in the BTC election in December 2020 but the BJP formed the government there in alliance with the United People’s Party Liberal. The State unit of Congress has expressed the need to exercise caution because of the possibility of the BJP trying to lure Mahajot candidates away in the event of a tight finish when the Assembly election results are declared on May 2.  We must be cautious in order to beat the BJP’s anti-democracy moves. From the past, we know the BJP can go to any length for a Congress-free India. They prevented us from forming governments in Goa, Manipur and Sikkim,  Congress MLA Devabrata Saikia said.",

"Kerala Assembly elections | Capital district records 70.01% turnout in peaceful polling",
52,
"The capital district recorded a polling percentage of 70.01% in the Assembly elections on Tuesday, as per the latest information available with the Election Commission. The numbers were bound to slightly increase with the final update of data from polling booths. In the Assembly elections of 2016, the district had recorded a polling percentage of 72.02%. Polling was largely peaceful across the district, except for an isolated incident of violence involving BJP and CPI(M) workers at Kattayikonam in the Kazhakuttam constituency. Police force was deployed in large numbers in the area to prevent further violence. As in the past, the rural areas of the district were ahead of the urban regions in voter enthusiasm, with most of the urban constituencies recording polling percentages lower than 70% and the rural constituencies recording more than 70%. The Aruvikkara constituency, consisting of remote polling stations in the high ranges, recorded the highest polling percentage of 73.27%, while the Thiruvananthapuram constituency in the heart of the city with easily accessible booths had a polling percentage of 61.92%. Nemom, the sole constituency won by the BJP in the State ever and which this year witnessed a tight triangular fight, had a relatively low polling percentage of 69.80%, compared to 74.11% in 2016.The case was similar in Kazhakuttam as well, which had a polling percentage of 69.63%, as against 73.46% last time. Shift in pattern The coastal regions witnessed a significant shift in voting pattern, as serpentine queues that used to be a common sight along the belt were missing this time. The setting up of auxiliary stations on account of the pandemic prevented crowding within the polling stations. COVID-19 protocol was largely adhered to across the district. While physical distancing could not be enforced owing to paucity of space in some booths, all other precautions were adopted. An adequate stock of disposable masks kept ready at all stations proved useful, with some voters, especially in the coastal areas, turning up without such protective gear.",

"Trinamool Congress is pressurising the Election Commission, says Modi",
55,
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of putting pressure on the Election Commission of India (EC) to thwart the polling process in West Bengal. Addressing a public meeting at Asansol in Paschim Bardhaman, Mr. Modi said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was  trying all means to subvert and stop the elections .  This time Didi (Ms. Banerjee) and her party are not being allowed to resort to rigging during the election. This is the reason why she is trying all means to subvert and stop the elections,  Mr. Modi said. The PM’s remarks come at a time when the TMC has urged the EC to merge the remaining three phases of polls in West Bengal due to an outbreak of COVID-19. Polling in the fifth phase of the Assembly elections was underway on Saturday. During his address, Mr. Modi raised the issue of the 2018 panchayat election in the State, and said that the people of Bengal had not forgotten how their democratic rights had been subverted during the local elections.  In 20,000 seats, which is almost one third of the total seats, TMC candidates won without a contest. Those who had filed their nomination from the Opposition had to take shelter in other States. Nomination papers had to submitted over the Internet on WhatsApp,  he said. The Prime Minister also referred to the communal riots in Asansol for three years on the occasion of Ram Navami celebrations and blamed the Chief Minister for the violence.  Who stood with rioters, who were indulging in politics of appeasement?  Mr. Modi asked the gathering. On the deaths at Sitalkuchi in the previous phase of polling, the Prime Minister said that the Chief Minister was indulging in politics over the deaths. On Friday, the BJP leadership had released audio tapes of a conversation between Ms. Banerjee and the TMC candidate after the Central Armed Forces opened fire resulting in the death of four persons at Jor Patki gram panchayat in Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar district. The TMC leadership said that there was nothing wrong in the conversation and raised questions over the taping of telephones of TMC leaders.

Later in the day, addressing another public meeting at Gangarampur in north Bengal, the Prime Minister said that politics had  crossed dangerous limits of vengeance .  Mamata Banerjee is abusing me almost every day as I raise the Trinamool Congress’s track record of corruption,  Mr. Modi said, referring to several remarks directed by the CM towards him in the last week of March and April.

"Santanu Hazarika and his world of cyborg queens and laser kings",
56,
"In Santanu Hazarika’s portrait of close friend, actor Shruti Haasan, she is half-human, half-robot, and wears a demure gaze, strokes of a yellow sun rising like wings from her back. A haloed Mother Mary — if she were a cyborg. Cool blue metallic portraits might be the Guwahati-native artist’s latest obsession, but the core idea still reflects his trademark affinity towards creating comic book characters out of people. Winner of the world’s first Red Bull World Doodle Art Champion in 2014, Santanu has been steadily building a name for himself in the world of visual art. His art finds a place in the albums of musicians such as Raftaar, Ritviz and Divine; on sneakers by Adidas and Reebok; as graffiti on walls; and most recently, on a Rajasthan Royals tour bus, for this year’s IPL season.Over the phone from Mumbai, where he is based out of now, Santanu explains how his fascination with comic books drew him to the world of art.  I designed the artwork for Major Lazer and Nucleya’s mix, ‘Jadi Buti’, in which these two characters: Bass Raja [drawn like an Indian king, an Amar Chitra Katha man with more defined abs] and DJ Lazer [a Jamaican hero shooting out lasers] are on a comic book cover,  he says.  These are two wildly different characters from different universes, in a crossover scene. Without any formal training in the subject, comics — from Spiderman and X-Men to Spawn and Dragon Ball Z, were his first inspiration. Headbanging to art  Back in school, I would draw sketches of these characters for friends, to earn canteen money,  recalls Santanu. A quid pro quo, he would continue well into engineering college (this time, for pints of beer). It was a bad phase for me. I really wanted to drop out, and take up graphic designing or animation, but I couldn’t. I had to undergo therapy for my depression. I would sit in class and just sketch all the time, even the teachers had given up on me,  he says. However, at the same time, word of his work spread and his musician friends in local bands from Guwahati and Shillong started requesting him to design their album art and equipment. Running parallel to his interest in drawing, was his interest in metal music, and the two fed into each other.  I loved listening to bands such as Iron Maiden, Megadeath, Cannibal Corpse,  he says. But what he loved just as much was looking at their album art.  Most of my artwork even now, is inspired by these old metal bands. They know how to give a face to their music. This idea of musical sounds lending to a visual representation is very interesting to me,  he says. Not surprisingly then, Santanu’s work has found favour in India’s growing indie music market, where musicians and artists alike are trying to carve a space that’s rebelliously un-Bollywood and yet Indian at heart. It shows in his work for Mc Altaf And Ikka of Gully Gang, and Seedhe Maut.",

"Koodiyattam on a wooden stool!",
57,
"One of the striking features of Kerala’s classical theatre forms is the concept of the use of space. Even while presenting larger-than-life mythological narratives, the size of the stage used in Koodiyattam or Kathakali is ideally around 150 sq. ft. The theory of body kinetics in these art forms emphasises the use of the eyes, face and the entire body in minimal space with the least movements to create the maximum impact. The act of lifting a mountain or crossing an ocean, for example, is done more with limbs and muscles and not through spatial movement. Koodiyattam goes even further in certain plays, and practically shrinks the stage to a wooden stool or peetam that is about 2 ft in diameter. One such instance is in the play Asokavanikankam, where Ravana, seeing Sita for the first time from his airborne chariot, is overcome with wonder and passion. Two descriptive segments Acting out the sloka ‘Indranimaham’ while standing on the peetam also involves two popular descriptive segments of Koodiyattam — ‘Kailasoddharanam’ and ‘Parvathiviraham’. While the former requires the actor to have a supple body to describe how Ravana tossed up Mount Kailas when his flying chariot was blocked by the mountain, the latter demands an expressive face to narrate the Siva and Parvati dialogue. Watching this solo act by Nepathya Rahul Chakyar at Nepathya Moozhikkulam in a four-hour ‘Nirvahanam’ or Retrospective segment is a lesson on how to use the body in Koodiyattam. Rahul was on the peetam for nearly two and a half hours, beginning from Ravana describing Sita’s beauty to recalling his visit to the prison where he had imprisoned the celestial beauties. To narrate how he saw Parvati doleful and angry, Ravana first describes the story of how he lifted and threw Mount Kailas. Only in the last segment of ‘Parvathiviraham,’ did the dancer get to sit down. Creating an imaginary mountain for the audience is no easy task. As he marvels at the majestic Kailas, Rahul stands tall on the stool, bends sideways, leans backwards, stands on tiptoe, and stoops low to trace the contours of the mountain. Then he goes on to describe its various features such as caves and sheer rock faces. Supported by the vibrant mizhavu and idakka drums, Rahul makes the audience experience water dropping from the mountain’s crevices and gathering strength to form a river. Rahul uses the peetam as if it was an extension of his limbs and finally he uproots the mountain and tosses it up high into the sky.How does this act differ from his other Koodiyattam roles? Rahul says there is much less freedom when standing on the stool and one has to scale down movements. The attaprakaram or the stage manual makes no allowance for changes in costume or actions in the descriptive passages to offset the space constraints. The challenge, says Rahul, is to create the same impact within the limited space. Performing while standing on a stool demands more concentration and stamina, since one has to always be aware of the foot position while at the same time maintaining the right expressions. The inputs needed, therefore, to create the same viewer experience are more when performing in a space that is a fraction of the normal stage. Rahul has performed this role twice before but in a pacha costume. This is the first time he is doing it in Ravana’s kathi make-up, which is more difficult because of the bigger headgear.  Rigorous practice is essential to avoid even a small misstep,  says Rahul. Initial lessons, when his guru taught him this sequence, took roughly one month. Nowadays, he practises for about a week before such a performance. Rahul believes that the beauty of Koodiyattam lies in creating a big impact by using one’s eyes and body to project maximum energy. The author, a retired journalist, writes on Kerala’s performing arts.",

"10 of Vivekh’s most iconic comedy roles in Tamil cinema",
58,
"A pall of gloom has descended on the Tamil film industry — and people like us who consume movies for entertainment — following the untimely demise of comedian-actor Vivekh at the age of 59. It is a hard pill to swallow considering the man more than once managed to succeed in making us laugh our hearts out to his antics on screen. Also Read | Get ‘First Day First Show’, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here His brand of comedy — unmatched as it is — most often involved a commentary-style criticism of things that burden or impact society; the criticism, however, came mixed with self-deprecatory or slapstick humour. Vivekh was also a master at imitation, having played characters that represent a stereotype or are modelled on famous names in Tamil cinema. Vivekh’s contributions to Tamil cinema has been acknowledged by the Government of Tamil Nadu numerous times, and his characters — impactful as they were during the time — remain deeply embedded in Tamil society’s memory fabric. Here, we remember the comedian and actor by rewinding the clock and looking at 10 of his iconic roles from among the many he brought to life on screen. Disclaimer: This list is in no way a definitive collection of Vivekh’s best works, but is only intended to serve as a tribute to a departed screen legend. 1. Pennin Manathai Thottu (2000) As Kandasamy, the medical college student/son of the local MLA, Vivekh delivered perhaps the most iconic of comedy dialogues ever delivered in Tamil cinema in the new millennium. Ringing up the late Dr Mathrubootham at midnight and asking him:  Neenga verum Das ah, illa Lord Labakku Das ah?  cracked up a generation of Tamil movie buffs, and continues to do so till date. His many gags after exposing his derriere to burn injuries was also one of the key reasons that made this film at least watchable. 2. Lovely (2001) As a film, Lovely wouldn’t exist for Tamil movie buffs if not for the intervention provided by Vivekh. Playing Azhages aka Al Gates, Vivekh’s run-ins with the ‘Monkey gulla’ group — and the laughter-inducing BGM every time they turn him into pulp and drop him on a hospital bed — was a hoot.",

"Gentle giant… that would best describe P. Vasanth Kumar, musician, mentor and writer, who passed away on Saturday. He was 65. He is survived by his wife, a son and daughter. Son of the late Sulochana Pattabhiraman, eminent musician and musicologist, he was a member of the Executive Committee of The Music Academy. It was in the company of the seven notes that he grew up, literally, imbibing the best from veterans. He carried his scholarship with aplomb and rare humility. A dedicated teacher, he imparted his knowledge holding nothing back, very much like his mother. After her demise, he took her young disciples under his wings, making the transition smooth. He not only nurtured talent, but helped merit find platform. A reliable resource person for The Hindu Friday Review, he contributed flawless write-ups. His radar would pick up any mistakes in reports on music. A gifted disciple of the doyen Pitchumani Iyer, Vasanth Kumar was a torchbearer of that pristine legacy, his veena producing pure melody. A connoisseur of all styles of music, he was an ardent fan of MLV.  It turned out that we named him perfectly,  chuckled his mother once, talking about Vasanth’s adoration of the genius.  He had details about MLV’s concerts on his fingertips,  says violin exponent Kanyakumari, for whom Vasanth was like a brother. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of music to whom we could turn to clear any doubt,  she says.  I have lost a genuine friend and an honest critic of my music,  says Sudha Ragunathan.  His large heart and open mind made him appreciate good music, irrespective of the parampara,  she adds. Recording his condolences on social media, historian V. Sriram said  Carnatic music has lost a scholar and fine vainika in the passing of P. Vasanth Kumar, for long a committee member of the Music Academy, and above all a dear friend of mine... At the Madras Music Academy he was a committee member who knew his music theory and put it to good use. ",

"‘Them’ review: Amazon’s horror series does not provide the catharsis it is supposed to",

"The poet was right about too much suffering making a stone of the heart. Little Marvin’s horror anthology, Them, is proof of the truth of the line from WB Yeats’ Easter 1916. How much punishment can the Emory family take from their racist neighbours and the malevolent spirits in their home before the viewers become comfortably numb? Also Read | Get ‘First Day First Show’, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here Each one of the 10 episodes, including the controversial episodes 5 and 9, show the Emorys being subjected to every kind of abuse starting with killing the family dog to rape, blinding, and the stomach-turning killing of a baby. There have been conversations around exploitation of black trauma, and pandering to the white gaze, with the cast and crew defending their choices. Lena Waithe, who executive produced alongside creator Little Marvin, said,  The first season will speak to how frightening it was to be black in 1953.  The question is who is the show speaking to — white or black audiences? What is the purpose? To make the whites feel guilty or the blacks remember?And then there are the horror elements — covenants, creaking doors, creepy, dim basements, jump scares, incongruous mirror reflections, gothic mental asylums, lobotomised patients, and that hoary chestnut of whether the visions are real or in the character’s mind. Horror is meant to entertain — so are the makers using black trauma for entertainment? Or using horror as a metaphor? The very fact that so many questions were coursing through my mind as I slogged through the ten episodes meant, the show had made a stone of my heart with its earnest depiction of all the horrors visited upon a human mind and body. There have been similarities drawn to Jordan Peele 2019 film, Us, with a common actor, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Lovecraft Country, an anthology set in the same time period. While Lovecraft Country used fantasy, horror and sci-fi to explore themes of race and gender, it also told a ripping good yarn stylishly. Them is beautifully shot, clothed, scored and acted, and not at all engaging. Even as one luxuriates in the beautiful frames, one’s attention wanders to Pink Floyd’s psychedelic excursions in ‘Us and Them’. The dreamy number from the iconic 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon, speaks of  black and blue  instead of the expected  black and white , hinting at police cars and a severe beating perhaps? As mentioned, the cast is superb from Deborah Ayorinde as Lucky, the traumatised mother to Shahadi Wright Joseph and Melody Hurd who play her daughters, Ruby Lee and Gracie. Ashley Thomas is the head of the family, Henry, traumatised by the Second World War and the ingrained racism of his workspace. Alison Pill with flowing, flared out ‘50s skirts, the cinched waist, softly curling blond hair and disconcerting sloe-black eyes, is the chief antagonist, Betty. Her arc is the most frustrating as after leading the charge for most part, she is moved to the sidelines... never to return. The horror does not provide the catharsis it is supposed to, and after a point all the pretty frames and dresses fail to propel the story along, as we watch the Emory family face yet another sling and arrow from outrageous fortune — and no, there is no terrible beauty being born either.",
